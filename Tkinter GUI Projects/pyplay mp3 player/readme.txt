If the script crashes on startup, problem might be cause by the backup files.

Here is the legend of backup files for you to decide which to remove in these circumstances:

RENAMEALLFILES.backup -> is the file created to keep tracking of the names when using MASS FILE EDITOR.
In this file is stored the original names of the .mp3 files. If you remove this, you will not be able
to undo Renaming for all the files.

PlayListBackup.pypl -> is the file which stores the details, and location of all the songs in 
your Playlist, if you remove this, the playlist is set to Defaults.


ALLARTISTTITLE.backup -> is the file created to keep tracking of the Artist and Title tags, when using
MASS FILE EDITOR to compose these 2 tags from FileName.


The .PNG files from "installation of pip libraries guide" have no functional impact, they are just a guide of how 
to install libraries, in order to use this script.

clear.mp3 is a file used to clear the playback when making some changes for the file currently loaded.
